Run this (you will need numpy, librosa, and aubio installed):

python songstitcher.py Boundless_170.wav Bounce_150 -b 75 -f 1 -t 1 -o BoundlessBounceMix_170.wav

This command takes the two songs, overlaps them by 75 beats, cross-fades the volume,
and makes the overall tempo match that of the first song.
The output file, BoundlessBounceMix_170.wav, is saved in the working directory.

This command run as-is will put the transition somewhere around 2:35
