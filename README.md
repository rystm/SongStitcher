What It Is
<br>
SongStitcher makes seamless transitions between songs a reality. 
It takes in two songs, shifts the tempo of one or both songs, 
and overlaps the songs by a specified number of beats, on the beat. 
It also gives the option to cross-fade the songs. 
The goal is to have no interruption in tempo, so that dancers can stay in their groove. 
The way to do that is to line up beats in the first song with beats in the second song, 
after they have been shifted to have matching tempos at the end of the first song and beginning of the next.
